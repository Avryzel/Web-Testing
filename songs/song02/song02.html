            It's full moon again
            Crazy how time flies
            One might wonder
            If past path was in a right direction
            But I do believe
            Things come to life by accident
            When it remains on
            Sounds like it's meant to be

            (Wake up)
            New space made when things fall apart
            (Get up)
            What matters after ending's how you left a mark
            (Don't wait up)
            Fire in my soul, fire in my heart
            'Til you see me on the other side of stars
            I'm running

            All the journeys start some where with a first step
            No one's sure what lies ahead, be bold and brave
            (Stand up)
            Roads may be rough and tough
            Though it will lead some where
            (Nothing easy, get up and go, get it, go)
            Sometimes it's journey itself that teaches
            A lot about the destination not aware of

            No matter how far (No matter how far)
            How you go (How you go, how you go)
            How long it may last
            (Carpe Diem, no time to waste)
            Venture life, burn your dread
            (You gotta venture life, go get it, burn your dread)

            When there's a beginning
            There's an ending too
            As we go we come across many predicaments
            Delight lies beneath
            Colors of life that's excellent
            Though pictures fade away
            Beauty will remain the same

            (Go)
            Stop living dead when your heart's beating still
            (Hope)
            No slowing down for me, I'm never gonna chill
            (Go)
            Every low phase, I ride it like a drill
            I'll abide by the rules, but outshine and prove

            Only time will tell the magnitude of deeds
            Longer we wait may it be the sweeter kiss
            (Or will it? Only time will tell)
            Standing by for answers
            Shall it ease the pain
            (Nothing easy, get up and go, get it, go)
            Only from the heart one reaches to the sky
            Ups and downs they go, so hands up and enjoy the ride

            As you go (As you go)
            Believe in (Believe in)
            The faith and yourself
            (Carpe Diem, no time to waste)
            Venture with no regret
            (You gotta venture life, go get it, no regret)

            Choices one makes reflect hope and fear
            Be brave, endure the pain
            Then one might just gain
            The strength one sought
            Which may be hearts and souls of life
            Meanings all of us search for

            Question, no answers
            Will this be for nothing?
            I felt so so worthless, and nervous, disgusted
            I would be so broken, unless I conducted
            Diligently, patiently, and trusted myself
            Nothing was given to me so gonna go earn it
            Every pain is another motivation, I burn it
            Trepidation doesn't stop death but it stops life
            Accepting open minds for lights

            One day these quiet voices will be heard
            Loud and clear, the story of the ones we miss
            (Stand up)
            But shed no tears
            Realize what they left behind
            (Nothing easy, get up and go, get it, go)
            Explore within the limits of the time
            No one should need a permit to a way of life

            No matter how far (No matter how far)
            How you go (How you go, how you go)
            How short it may last
            (Carpe Diem, no time to waste)
            Venture life, burn your dread
            (You gotta venture life, go get it, burn your dread)
